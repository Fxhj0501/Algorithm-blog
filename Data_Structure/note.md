## Singly Linked List

### 1. Principle

#### 1.1 What is a singly link list like?

Linked list is a linear data structure,but the elements of it are not stored an a contiguous location(pointers).

#### 1.2 Why we use it?

- **Advantages**:

  - The size of arrays is fixed. So when we don't know the upper limit of arrays, we can't use it. But when we need a new linked list node, we can create a linked list node dynamically and connect it by using  pointer to connect with former nodes.

  - It's easy for us to insert/delete linked list node.

- Drawbacks:

  -
